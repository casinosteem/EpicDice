# What EPC is good for

EPC is the native token of EpicDice powered by Steem-Engine. It is fully transferable and tradeable on the SE DEX. By far, the only way to mint new EPC token from the contract is by wagering on the \[gaming platform\]\(epicdice.io\). The house is giving away EPC from the team's holding on a constant basis via various events. But what good EPC is for?

**Receive dividend automatically**

Daily dividend is the first and main feature EPC introduced. Half of the traceable house profit is poured in the dividend pool in real-time. And the end of the day, any Steem account holding positive EPC balance receive dividend payout automatically, directly into the pocket.

**Wagerable and win STEEM**

This is essentially the [most fun feature](https://steemit.com/epicdice/@epicdice/bet-epc-win-steem) of EPC. Players get to wager EPC and win STEEM from a standalone, house-sponsored prize pool at 72 STEEM daily rate\(over 2.5k STEEM has been won away as of now\), generous [EpicBomb](https://steemit.com/epicdice/@epicdice/bombarding-epc-players-with-steem) would greatly thickening the pool randomly too. Winning or losing in betting EPC, certain amount of token would be burnt and gradually increase EPC value over time.

**Maximum liquidity, no staking**

EPC is designed with simplicity in mind. No staking in the system for maximum liquidity. Every piece of EPC serves the owner well no matter what strategy has been chosen. Leave it idling in the account, it brings in daily dividend. Wager it to win STEEM if you like more of a gambling flavour. Or even [sell](https://steem-engine.com/?p=market&t=EPC) it away in free market for feeding the relatively high demand.

**Ever-increasing EPC Rate**

EPC Rate is internally being used in EPC betting and thanks for the brilliant burning system, EPC Rate will only go up as more tokens are burnt\(over 32m EPC has been burnt as of now\). Furthermore, it is going to be doubled during every halving of EPC mining rate. EPC is going to get more attractive going down the road.
