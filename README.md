# EPC Betting System

## Bet EPC, win STEEM

Using the internal EPC rate, players can wager with EPC and win away not only with most of the token wager, but full prize in STEEM.

The workflow is simple and **5%** of wagered EPC is guaranteed to be burnt. In a winning case of EPC betting, players get back 95% EPC wager and full prize in STEEM from the prize pool. In the losing case, however, 100% of the EPC wager got burnt by sending to @null.

_Eg. Sam wagered 1m EPC \(equals to 10 STEEM\) rolling under 81\(1 pays 1.225\) and won, he gets back 950k EPC, plus not 2.25 STEEM but the full 12.25 STEEM!_

### 72 STEEM flow into the prize pool daily

Prize pool for token betting is fully independent and standalone with **3 STEEM flowing to @epicpool every hour**, making up to 72 STEEM giving out every day.

It is designed in the way that serving as a secondary source of STEEM prize other than the daily dividend which shall further incentivize players in platform engagement. Dropping consistent prize at fixed timing into the pool ensuring our user base across all the time zones, will have a fair chance hitting the pot.

Pool will be capped at 300 STEEM and token betting is disabled when it is drained.

### Internal EPC rate, that only knows to go up

EpicDice is probably the first blockchain casino to tie its own native token'value with coin of mother-chain \(STEEM in this case\).

Starting with base rate **100k EPC = 1 STEEM**, EpicDice establish a solid correlation of EPC with STEEM, just like SBD is forever pegged to 1 US Dollar internally in Steem algorithm. Except EPC rate is going to rise over time!

_Halving_ and _token burning_ are the two contributing factors here. For instance, when the first EPC halving happens, the difficulty of minting doubled and EPC rate shall be doubled to 2 STEEM accordingly. On top of that, scarcity was boosted in the process of gaming as tokens were burnt, that would generously compliment the growth of EPC rate too.

All in all, EPC has never been this sexy and powerful. There is literally no excuse not to get more of it now!
